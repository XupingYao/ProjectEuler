 "\nEach character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred \
standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).For \
example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*)=42,and lowercase k=107. A modern \
encryption method is to take a text file,convert the bytes to ASCII,then XOR \
each byte with a given value,taken from a secret key.The advantage with the \
XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher \
text,restores the plain text;for example,65 XOR 42=107,then 107 XOR 42=65. \
For unbreakable encryption,the key is the same length as the plain text \
message,and the key is made up of random bytes.The user would keep the \
encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations,and without \
both \"halves\",it is impossible to decrypt the message.Unfortunately,this \
method is impractical for most users,so the modified method is to use a \
password as a key.If the password is shorter than the message,which is \
likely,the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message.The balance for \
this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security,but short \
enough to be memorable.Your task has been made easy,as the encryption key \
consists of three lower case characters.Using cipher.txt (right click \
and'Save Link/Target As...'),a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes,and \
the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words,decrypt \
the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text."

# A collection of Project Euler problems solutions

## About Project Euler
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.  
The homepage of this project reads https://projecteuler.net/.

## My solutions
Each solved problem has a notebook file written in Mathematica i.e. Wolfram language.  
However, there are several hard problems which is also written in C/C++ language additionally, because the only feasible method I achieved is brute force.  
Under this circumstances, it is not easy to obtain efficient Mathematica code even though I try my best to optimize it.  
However, C/C++ code can done well and get the correct answer in seconds.

In most Mathematica notebook, more than one solution is offered.  
The first solution in each problem is almost always entirely original by myself while the rest solutions written by ohters are copied from websites such as the thread for problems in the official forum just for comparison and learning.  
Therefore, all copyright reserved by the code authors we cannot list here and their intelligence should be appreciated.

## Attention
In fact, the founders of project euler advise us not to publish our solution elsewhere after we solved one problem.  
So, I declare that this code is provided for reference only.  
Please do not copy the answer directly to pass the challenge.
